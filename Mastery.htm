                        Instructor of juggling is a person who teach how to juggle other people. You will need good knowledge 
                        about juggling and the ability to teach people of different ages and classes. This work is 
                        similar to the work of a teacher or trainer and is suitable for calm people who can convey the main 
                        aspects of juggling through words and actions. <br>
                        If you recognize yourself from the lines above, we advise you to visit

                <p> 
                    However, the other option is to become a "street juggler", traveling the world and demonstrating 
                    various skills on the street. This is good choice for people who do not consider juggling a duty 
                    and prefer freedom. <br> To become such a juggler, you will need to overcome many obstacles and, 
                    also, stop hoping for a quiet life, because now every day is a new adventure. In addition, such 
                    qualities as confidence, eloquence, the ability to improvise are needed, and it would be great to 
                    know other tricks besides juggling. The more tricks you know, the higher your chances of success. 
                    To get started, take everything you need, go outside and show your abilities for a decent fee. 
                    After you understand that people are bored and stop giving enough money, we recommend moving to 
                    another place, city or country. And try to find yourself there. When you have a permanent place 
                    to live, try to never disappoint your viewers and always be better than yesterday!
