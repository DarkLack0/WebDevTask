                        Instructor of juggling is a person who teach how to juggle other people. You will need good knowledge 
                        about juggling and the ability to teach people of different ages and classes. This work is 
                        similar to the work of a teacher or trainer and is suitable for calm people who can convey the main 
                        aspects of juggling through words and actions. <br>
                        If you recognize yourself from the lines above, we advise you to visit 
                        <a href="https://juggle.jobs/">available jobs</a>.

                <h2>Or... Show your skills in the street</h2>

                <p> 
                    However, the other option is to become a "street juggler", traveling the world and demonstrating 
                    various skills on the street. This is good choice for people who do not consider juggling a duty and prefer freedom. <br>
                    To become such a juggler, you will need to overcome many obstacles and, also, stop hoping for a quiet life, 
                    because now every day is a new adventure. In addition, such qualities as confidence, eloquence, the 
                    ability to improvise are needed, and it would be great to know other tricks besides juggling.                    
                    The more tricks you know, the higher your chances of success. To get started, take everything 
                    you need, go outside and show your abilities. After you realize that people are bored with seeing 
                    you, move to another place or city, or country...
